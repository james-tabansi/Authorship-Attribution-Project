# Authorship-Attribution-Project

**Authorship Attribution Project**

## **Problem Statement:**

The task of authorship attribution involves identifying the author of a given text based on linguistic patterns and writing style. In the context of this project, the challenge is to develop an authorship attribution application specifically tailored for philosophical texts attributed to either Plato or Aristotle. Despite being contemporaries and influential figures in ancient Greek philosophy, Plato and Aristotle had distinct writing styles and philosophical methodologies. Hence, the aim is to create a robust classification model capable of accurately categorizing philosophical texts as authored by either Plato or Aristotle based on linguistic features and textual analysis.

The key challenges in this project include:
1. **Text Cleaning:** This involved preprocessing the text to a desirable format for modeling and EDA
   
2. **Feature Extraction:**  Extracting relevant linguistic features and representations from the text that capture the unique writing styles, semantics and philosophical tendencies of Plato and Aristotle.
   
3. **Model Training:** Developing and training a machine learning or natural language processing model capable of effectively distinguishing between texts authored by Plato and Aristotle.
   
4. **Performance Evaluation:** This involved evaluating the performance of the models used based on the following metrics: ROC-AUC score and f1 score.


By addressing these challenges, the goal is to create an authorship attribution application that not only accurately identifies the author of a given philosophical text but also provides insights into the distinctive writing styles and philosophical ideologies of Plato and Aristotle. This project has implications for fields such as digital humanities, literary studies, and computational linguistics, offering new avenues for analyzing and understanding ancient philosophical texts and their authors' contributions to Western thought.
